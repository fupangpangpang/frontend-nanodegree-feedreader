# Feed Reader Jasmine Testing


## How to Run

Download or clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser locally.  All needed Jasmine libraries are included, and a section below the page will show the test results.

To add or edit the feed sources, open `js/app.js` and change the `allFeeds` object.  Ensure that you have at least 2 feeds, or else the 'New Feed Selection' test will fail.
